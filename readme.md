## Development

This is only set up to work in modern browsers with support for Javascript modules. There is no build or transpile step!

However, I did choose to use Twig for the HTML, so you'll need to run `$ npm install` and then `$ npm run watch` to generate an `index.html` file in the `public` directory.

You can upload the entire `public` directory to your server at any time.
